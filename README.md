# NLP-to-SQL
Python-based Natural Language to SQL Query Converter using OpenAI's GPT model. This tool allows users to interact with SQL databases using natural language queries, making database interactions more accessible to non-technical users.


## Important Note

This repository contains a prototype implementation:
- The database file is a placeholder and needs to be replaced with your actual database
- The OpenAI API key in the code is a placeholder (you will need to use your own API key)
- Test scenarios are included for demonstration purposes only
